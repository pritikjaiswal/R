### As the data is character we cannot carry normality test and variance test.
## 2 proportion test
prop.test(x= c(66,47), n=c(233, 167), conf.level = 0.95, alternative = "greater")
## the P value=0.5. which is > 0.05. we fail to reject null. 
prop.test(x= c(66,47), n=c(233, 167), conf.level = 0.95, alternative = "two.sided")
## the p value = 1. which is > 0.05. we fail to reject null.

## the P value=0.5. which is > 0.05. we fail to reject null.
